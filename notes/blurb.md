# What is Flowmodoro?

Flowmodoro is the only Pomodoro timer that understands your life is hectic. It works just like a regular Pomodoro timer, but allows you to be flexible on the length of your focus sessions *without* punishing you.

- Click "Focus" to start the focus timer.
- Every 5 seconds of focus, Flowmodoro grants you 1 second of focus time. That amounts to 5 minutes of break after 25 minutes of focus.
- When you click "Break", the focus timer pauses, and the break timer starts counting down with whatever amount you have accumulated.
- As long the break timer stays above 0, you can click "Focus" to resume the focus timer where it left off.
- Once you have focused for 25 minutes, you have completed a focus session (we call it a Pom)!
- After completing 4 focus sessions, you've completed a Clover! For every Clover completed, Flowmodoro grants you an instant 15 minutes of break.
- Keep flowing, do what you need to do, and kick back once you're done :)

## The Pomodoro Technique

Flowmodoro is primarily inspired by the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique), which is a strategy to encourage focused blocks of work. When starting to work, you set a timer for 25 minutes. At the end of the 25 minutes, you take a 5 minute break. After 4 sessions, you take a longer break for 15-30 minutes.

## Shortcomings of Pomodoro

Pomodoro by itself is *great*. It has been an invaluable tool for me as I cultivate my ability to focus, and I highly recommend it. After extended use, though, I started to notice some shortcomings.

Primarily, it felt like Pomodoro was punishing me for any deviation from the 25 minute timer. If ever I had to take a break early - say, 15 minutes into the session I was interrupted for an important conversation or *really* had to go to the bathroom - I had no idea how much credit to give myself. Should I take the full 5 minute break and say I completed the session, or should I scrap the session and start fresh for the next one? In the first case, I felt like I was patting myself on the back for something I didn't deserve. In the second case, I felt like I failed the session, and was left defeated and unmotivated to start over.

The same went for times that I felt "in flow" and wanted to continue focusing for longer than 25 minutes. If I focus for 40 minutes before I start to feel distracted, should I power through the last 10 minutes to complete two sessions even though I'm not actually focused, or should I take a break? And then I have to grapple with the questions of stopping early again. Did I really only earn a 5 minute break for that extra focus, or should I round up to 10? Did I complete two focus sessions or just one?

It felt like Pomodoro just wasn't flexible enough to accommodate my capricious work ethic. So I started counting my own time.

## Habitica, Short Term Goal Accountability, Poms, and Clovers

Another tool I tried in my productivity journey was [Habitica](https://habitica.com), a gamified habit tracking game where you can join communities to help you achieve your goals. My favorite community there is the Short Term Accountability Guild, which hosts regular challenges for counting your completed focus sessions with the Pomodoro technique. They had a novel take on counting the sessions in time equivalencies, namely:

- A "Pom" is the equivalent of 25 focused minutes in a 30-minute period.
- A "Clover" is the equivalent of 100 focused minutes in a 120-minute period, or 4 Poms in 2 hours.

Importantly, these measures don't care if those focus minutes were contiguous. If you wanted to, say, focus for 15 minutes, take a 5 minute break, then focus for 10 minutes - that still counts as a Pom! Similarly, if you wanted to focus for 50 minutes straight, break for 20 minutes, then focus another 50 minutes straight, that counts as a Clover!

These challenges inspired me to find a better way to count my focus sessions so I could give myself exactly the amount of credit I deserved, regardles of how distracted or locked-in I was. After all, I wanted to win the prizes, but I wanted to win them fair and square.

The solution I decided on is Flowmodoro, and while the exact implementation is still in flux, I'm pretty happy with where it's ended up. Give it a try and let me know what you think!
